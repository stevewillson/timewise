Timewise is a simple time tracking system that provides a graphical way of viewing a daily plan and then capturing actual time spent.

Two timegrids are displayed:
Planning | Tracking

Clicking the timegrid adds an event, events can be resized and moved. Clicking on an event edits the title, dragging an event off the screen removes the event.
